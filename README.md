# Constructing A Large-Scale Reaction Mechanism Dataset Using A Template-Based Search Algorithm
This repository contains the code and resources for Constructing *A Large-Scale Reaction Mechanism Dataset Using A Template-Based Search Algorithm*. The project creates a reaction mechanism dataset using reaction SMILES and faciliate reaction mechanism predictions using different models.

# Requirements
For the dataset creation, the following packages are required:

python==3.8.19
numpy==1.24.3
pandas==2.0.3
rdkit==2024.3.3
scipy==1.10.1
tqdm==4.65.0

For model training and prediction, the packages required is recorded in the respective folders.

# Dataset creation
For dataset creation, please prepare your database in a file which each line contains a reaction SMILES. Then go to main.py and change the path to your database file and run the main.py file to create the dataset.

# Model training and prediction
We have examined our dataset with the following models:

    Retrosynthesis-Prediction Model: Located in the Retrosynthesis-Prediction folder.
    Transformer: Located in the Transformer folder.
    Graph2SMILES: Located in the Graph2SMILES folder.

For detailed setup and usage instructions, refer to the README.md file located in each model folder. Simply navigate to your preferred modelâ€™s folder and follow the steps outlined in its README.
